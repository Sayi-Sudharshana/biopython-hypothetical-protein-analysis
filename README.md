# biopython-capstone-project
**Overview**
Computational analysis and functional annotation of a hypothetical viral protein using Biopython, BLAST, and domain-based inference. The project follows a step-by-step sequence-to-function pipeline including sequence quality assessment, homology search, and biological interpretation.

**Biological Interpretation:**
The analyzed sequence represents a conserved hypothetical viral protein containing the DUF2460 domain. 
Sequence quality analysis confirmed that the protein has an appropriate length and composition, indicating good sequence quality.
Homology search using BLASTp revealed significant similarity to conserved hypothetical proteins across related organisms, suggesting evolutionary conservation.
The presence of the DUF2460 domain indicates that the protein is likely to play an important biological role, although its exact function remains uncharacterized.
These observations support the prediction that the protein may be involved in essential viral or host-interaction processes, warranting further experimental investigation.

**Learning Outcomes**
Through this project, I learned:
1. How to retrieve and handle biological sequences from public databases
2. How to perform sequence quality checks and homology searches
3. How to interpret BLAST results for functional inference
4. How to use Biopython for real bioinformatics tasks
5. How to write clean and readable Python code, including:
   Using newline characters (\n) to format outputs properly which was learnt and executed out of interest outside class lessons
   Writing structured result files programmatically
6. How to learn and apply coding concepts beyond classroom teaching through hands-on problem solving
7. How to document a scientific project clearly using GitHub and README files

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how a hypothetical viral protein can be systematically analyzed using bioinformatics tools to generate meaningful biological insights, even in the absence of prior functional characterization.
